# Lending Club Case Study
> A Brief about LendingClub:

A Data Analytics Project Identifies Loan Defaulter

Problem statement : To analyse risk in banking and financial services and understand how data is used to minimise the risk of losing money while lending to customers. Two types of risks are associated with the bank’s decision:

● If the applicant is likely to repay the loan, then not approving the loan results in a loss of business to the company.

● If the applicant is not likely to repay the loan, i.e. he/she is likely to default, then approving the loan may lead to a financial loss for the company.

## Problem Solving Methodology

* Data Understanding
  Understand Data with the help of data dictionary get significance of each column.

* Data Cleaning
  Removing null valued columns, single uniques columns, unnecessary columns then manipulation of data such as conversion of data types, removing outliers, deriving new variables and many more

* Univariate Analysis
  Analysing each columns and plotting the distribution of each to get more information.

* Bivariate Analysis
  Through this we can analyse two variables and determine empirical relationship between them.

* Conclusion
  Identify the risky loan applicants at the time of loan application so that such loans can be reduced thereby cutting down the amount of credit loss. Identification of such applicants using EDA is the aim of this case study.
